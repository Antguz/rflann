# rflann

Basic R interface to the FLANN C++ library.

Windows users may not be able to install this package.
I will be travelling until mid-July and will work on this issue
when I come back. In the mean time, it should work on Debian and
Ubuntu.

Please contact me by email (jeremyyee@outlook.com.au) or
through my github account to report any issues.
